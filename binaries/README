Steps to run the server -

1) Copy the boltdb-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar, dgrep and boltdb.prop files into a folder.
2) cd into the folder to which you copied the above files.
3) Run the command - "./dgrep -startServer 1 6789"
	*	Here, 1 is the serverId and 6789 is the port number. 
	*	While starting the server on different machines, you need to specify different serverIds. 
	*	If you are running multiple servers on localhost, you need to specify different serverId 
		and different port for each server.


Steps to run the client -
1) Copy the boltdb-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar, dgrep and boltdb.prop files into a folder (If you have already 
   copied these files in the previous step (while running the server), you should be fine.
2) cd into the folder to which you copied the above files.
5) Edit the boltdb.prop file to add the ipaddress and port details of the servers in the system.
3) Run the command - "./dgrep -key <keyRegExp> -value <valRegExp>
	*	Here <keyRegExp> and <valRegExp> are the key and value regular expressions that you wish
		to search.

Steps to run the unit tests -

1) Copy the boltdb-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar, dgrep and boltdb.prop files into a folder (If you have already 
   copied these files in the previous steps (while running the server/client) you should be fine.
2) Copy the folder unit_tests(along with its subfolders) to the folder in which you have the above files.
3) Run the command - "java -cp boltdb-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar edu.uiuc.boltdb.logquerier.LogQuerierTest -generateLogs"
	*	This command generates 3 log files in the current folder
4) Make sure you start 3 servers (with ids 1, 2 and 3) on the same machine or different machines on EWS.
5) Edit the boltdb.prop file to add the ipaddress and port details of these 3 servers.
6) Run the command - "java -cp boltdb-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar edu.uiuc.boltdb.logquerier.LogQuerierTest unit_test_1
	*	You can also run the command with "unit_test_2" or "unit_test_3" options
	*	You can add your own unit tests by creating a folder with the unit test name under "unit_tests/"
		and creating a unit_test.prop file inside the newly created folder. Add your key and value regular
		expressions as two properties into this file.
